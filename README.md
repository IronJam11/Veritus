## 🚀 Submission for Etherlink Hackathon 2025: Collab Culture Track

**“Collab Culture” is about collective creation, co-ownership, and community-powered value. Veritus turns this vision into reality—onchain.**

### Why build Veritus on Etherlink?

- **Ultrafast & Scalable:** Soft confirmations <500ms. Optimized for creators and fans worldwide.
- **(Nearly) Free:** Fraction-of-a-cent transaction fees; anyone can participate, no matter where they are.

## What is Veritus?

**Veritus** is where community, creativity, and trust converge.

It’s a fully decentralized platform that lets anyone—artist, coder, filmmaker, entrepreneur, DAO—tokenize creative assets, distribute fractional ownership, and align incentives between all contributors. Every asset becomes a collaborative mini-economy, with transparent, programmable royalties and co-governance.

**On Veritus, every participant has a stake. Every contribution is recognized. Every value flow is transparent.**

### Built *for* Collaboration

#### 1. Shared Ownership, Real Incentives  
Any asset can have multiple creators, supporters, and investors. Everyone gets their fair share—transparently and automatically.

#### 2. Community-Led Verification  
DAO voting and reputation staking let the group decide what’s authentic, valuable, and meaningful.

#### 3. Permissionless Participation  
No gatekeepers. Anyone can create, invest, verify, and govern. Bring your friends, your DAO, your collective—or just yourself.

#### 4. Cross-Asset and Cross-Community  
Mix and match asset types. Pool revenue streams. Build culture, not just code.

## Example: Tokenizing a Collaborative Short Film

Imagine a global team co-creates a short film. Here’s how Veritus works:

- **Issuers:** 6 team members mint 1,000 shares of their film
- **Split:** 500 shares kept by creators, 500 sold to backers for $2/share
- **Royalties:** YouTube, streaming, licensing, and merchandise profits flow into the smart contract
- **Distribution:** Quarterly, all shareholders receive their cut—automatically, globally, and verifiably
- **Governance:** Fans and backers vote on future directions, sequel funding, and licensing decisions

- **Story Protocol:** IP management and programmable licensing embedded at the protocol layer
- **Tomo Wallet Integration:** Frictionless wallet onboarding and social login for truly global collaboration
